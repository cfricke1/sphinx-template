React – a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. (n.d.).

I used this website just to get a basic understanding of what
React is and how people can use it. I assumed the main website
for the platform would be a great way to start, as it went, into
great detail about all the different thing you can accomplish
while using React. For example, users can create applications,
simple and stateful components, components using external plugins,
and a number of other things. This site was very helpful in helping
me understand the basics of React and get a quick overview of
what is is.

Aggarwal, S. (2018). Modern Web-Development using ReactJS. International
Journal of Recent Research Aspects, 5(1), 133–137.

This article by S. Aggarwal gives a great deal of information on
how React is used for modern development. He also goes into detail
on the backend of React and how everything works together. One of
the things I could take away from this article is how programmers
today are actually using and benefiting from using React. Aggarwal
gives a number of examples of different real life scenarios where
React made the job easier.

This video is extremely long but gives a ton of detail on absolutley everything
you need to know about React. I did not watch the entire video,
as it runs for nine hours, but I was able to skip through and watch bits
and pieces. This conference video tells you everything from the basics
to how to integrate other programming software with React. If I ever need
to learn a great amount about React, this is the video to use.

This book is a great source for beginners in React and experts.
I was able to get ahold of just the first chapter for a preview of it
but just from that chapter I was able to tell the rest of the book would
be great for learners. The book has chapters over every aspect of React
and could be used by anyone and everyone that is working with it.
I would easily buy the book and get into it if I ever seriously got into React.

My final website that I reviewed was from w3schools. Their website gave
a quick and brief description of some of the basic coding that you would be
using with React. As a beginner, this would be the place to go to learn how
to set up and get your app running successfully. They give a quick
but full description of what you need to do to get it running and how it works.
